Yes.

## Good day, and thank you for stopping by.

It is, of course, entirely possible that you have arrived here by accident.  
Perhaps you meant to visit another profile ‚Äî one belonging to a developer of considerably more renown. But alas, here we are.  
Permit me to introduce myself.

## üï¥Ô∏è Who I am

I am a person driven less by routine than by relentless curiosity ‚Äî particularly about the uneasy relationship between low-level system behavior and the occasionally overdecorated abstractions layered atop it.  
Some years ago, dissatisfied with the constraints of high-level languages (which, while useful, often lacked a certain *grit*), I began constructing my own JVM assembly language.  
Not out of hubris, I assure you ‚Äî more a quiet defiance than a grand gesture.

As to *why*... one might speculate that I simply enjoy suffering.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Do

- I develop IntelliJ plugins. Not because anyone asked me to, but because certain problems simply refused to be ignored.  
- I study the architecture of digital security. Some might say obsessively, though I find the term insufficiently precise.  

If pressed, I might admit to holding a number of qualifications ‚Äî not for the prestige, you understand, but because being wrong irritates me.

### üéµ Passions and Pastimes

I find solace in listening to music, the kind that lingers just beneath the surface of thought.  
Writing code, too ‚Äî a deliberate act of creation and destruction, line by line.  
And reading, which offers quiet journeys through minds both familiar and foreign.

Below is a small token of my musical tastes ‚Äî a modest emblem from Apple Music, where many of my quiet moments unfold.

## üìú Qualifications

I am in possession of an **IT Passport** ‚Äî a document of quiet dignity issued by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.  
Though it permits neither international travel nor visa stamps, it has nonetheless opened many conceptual borders.

<details>
<summary>Other certifications</summary>

- **Information Security Management Examination**  
  A study in policies, governance, and the quiet terror of compliance checklists.

- **Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Examination**  
  A rite of passage involving sorting algorithms, hexadecimal math, and selective memory loss.

- **Applied Information Technology Engineer Examination**  
  Where one is expected not only to understand systems, but to explain them. In writing. To humans.

- **Network Specialist Examination**  
  TCP, UDP, BGP, and other acronyms that eventually begin to sound like distant relatives.

- **Registered Information Security Specialist (RISS)**  
  A nationally appointed cybersecurity expert ‚Äî entrusted, in theory, with protecting the digital infrastructure of the nation.  
  While it does not come with a secret base or a trench coat (yet), the title carries weight in certain circles ‚Äî particularly among those who prefer their encryption strong and their coffee stronger.

### üß™ Selected Oddities

- **A JVM assembler** that speaks `.jal` and occasionally talks back.  
- **A persistent belief** that placing `{` on the same line is a moral failing.  
- I engage in the creation of Minecraft and PaperMC plugins, not merely as a pastime, but as a quiet profession.  
- My affection for Java runs deep, yet it is the enigmatic heart of the JVM that holds my truest fascination ‚Äî a realm where complexity is veiled in subtle grace.

## üåç Languages I Navigate

It may seem peculiar to enumerate the languages one speaks, especially when the act itself risks appearing boastful or unnecessary. Yet, here they are ‚Äî the means by which I attempt to bridge myself to others, or perhaps to myself.

- **Japanese** ‚Äî my mother tongue, an old and familiar companion, woven into the very fabric of my thoughts.  
- **English** ‚Äî a language I have wrestled with over the years; serviceable enough for conversations, technical discourse, and occasional irony.  
- **Latin** ‚Äî a faint echo from a distant past; enough to conjure phrases and fragments, but never a full conversation.  
- **Esperanto** ‚Äî an experiment in idealism, learned with quiet hope and modest skill, though rarely spoken aloud.

### üóí Final Notes

I compose code as some collect rare tomes; with excessive care, a mild disdain for the ways of others, and a faint hope that someday, someone shall take notice.
Should you wish to collaborate, contribute, or simply voice your bewilderment‚Äîyou are most heartily welcome.
